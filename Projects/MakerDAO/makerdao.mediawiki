==Short Description==

Maker introduced the Dai Stablecoin System consisting of a DAO and various actors on the Ethereum blockchain. Their goal is to create an on-chain asset-backed and collateralized coin that is pegged to the USD. In order to achieve this, a user can create a smart contract called Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) that has to be funded with any kind of collateral the user wants to deposit. As soon as the CDP is collateralized, the respective amount (lower than the collateral's value) of Dai is sent to the user. There are several price stability mechanisms that ensure the 1:1 convertibility to USDs. The Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM) for instance is an incentive mechanism for users to either hold or to borrow Dai, which influences the price development and restores the peg to the USD. In addition, a sensitivity parameter determines to which extent the Target Rate adjusts to market price deviations. There are several key actors playing a crucial role in the ecosystem. The centerpiece are MKR voters holding MKR tokens who are empowered to govern the system. They can submit proposals to modify governance variables, determine the sensitivity parameter, set risk parameters that for example define collateral-to-debt ratio and more. Other actors include trusted Oracles, which are chosen by MKR voters, providing off-chain price information. Ultimately, Keepers are profit-oriented agents who trade Dais around the Market price and thereby contribute to a stable 1:1 USD peg.<ref name="whitepaper">https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/, accessed on 23.10.2018.</ref>
