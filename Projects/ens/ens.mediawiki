==Short Description==

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a project originally initiated by the Ethereum Foundation, whose development has later been moved to True Names Ltd.<ref name=„company“/> The ENS is an open and decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain (main chain).<ref name=„website“/> It is designed to assign human-readable names (domains) to machine-readable identifiers such as public keys/external accounts and contract addresses. The initial top level domain (TLD) was „.eth“ but arbitrary TLDs can be chosen. There are two main elements constituting the ENS: the registry and resolvers. The former is a smart contract storing all domains, subdomains and some key information such as the domain’s owner and the associated resolver. Resolvers, in contrast to the registry itself, conduct the translation of domain names into their corresponding address or hash.<ref name=„documentation“/> This task can be fulfilled by any contract that implements the relevant standard but is generally done by the public resolver.<ref name=„documentation“/><ref name=„zinsmeister“>https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/blockchain-in-the-real-world-ethereum-name-service-58b859de6a30, accessed on 12.07.2018.</ref> In order to distribute domain names, users are required to send bids to the smart contract (registrar). Subsequently, a sealed bid auction mechanism allocates the names among bidding users. Once the domain has been acquired, the owner controls all appertaining subdomains. For instance, if the University of Basel obtains ownership of the domain „unibasel.eth“ it is put in charge of each subdomain ending with „.unibasel.eth“ (e.g. cif.unibasel.eth).<ref name=„zinsmeister“/> Thus, transactions to the Ethereum address of the University of Basel could be sent to the domain „unibasel.eth“.
