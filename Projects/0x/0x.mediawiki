==Short Description==


0x is an open protocol for decentralized exchange based on the Ethereum blockchain. In the crypto ecosystem, exchanges act as portals between the Fiat and the crypto world as well as they allow trading of cryptos in exchange for other cryptos. Problematic about the offered services is that exchanges often act in centralized manner, which exposes users to a potential higher risk of vulnerability and mismanagement. The 0x protocol is based on public accessible smart contracts, which allow users to maintain full ownership over their digital funds. Further 0x can be used as a Plug-In dApp for other projects. Since transactions triggered by Smart Contracts always produce GAS fees in Ethereum, 0x deployed an order process that allows users to place their trade orders off-chain. Relayers - entities that host and maintain an order book - facilitate trading by broadcasting all the off-chain orders of the 0x network to the rest of the network and therefore matching buyer and seller. Once a transaction is successfully transmitted, the relayer receives a fee in ZRK tokens while the transfer of value is submitted to the Ethereum blockchain. Next to this broadcast order there is also the possibility to trade as market maker (seller) directly with another party via messaging systems such as Reddit, Whatsapp, Email etc. Therefore the order consists of data packages that are cryptographically secured by an ECDSA signature. Only the taker (buyer) can trigger the transfer of the funds. This kind of order is called Point-to-Point Order. <ref>https://0xproject.com/pdfs/0x_white_paper.pdf, access 09/17/18.</ref><ref>https://blockgeeks.com/guides/0x-project/, access 09/17/18.</ref><ref>https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-0x-protocol-zrx/, access 09/17/18.</ref>
