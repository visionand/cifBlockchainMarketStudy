==Short Description==

SALT Lending offers a membership-based platform for crypto-backed loans where lenders and borrowers can be connected to each other. This allows a user to keep holding his crypto asset while at the same time being able to unlock its value. To do so, coins must be deposited into a multi-signature smart contract on its native blockchain. Hereby, the SALT Oracle monitors transactions between the parties and price development of the assets. Besides, it is responsible for storing the collateral and sending alerts in case of significant price changes. As a precaution, loans are overcollateralized, meaning that in order to access a loan in the amount of P, crypto assets worth more than P must be deposited as a collateral. The ration between the loan and the value of the stored coins is called loan-to-value-ratio (LVR) and must be met at any point of time. That is, if the collateral's value depreciates the LVR rises, which in turn requires the borrower to either deposit more assets or repay parts of the loan. If the borrower fails to take one of these measures, the SALT Oracle may initiate a partial liquidation of the collateral. In turn, if the borrower repays parts of the loan, the LRV decreases and improves, ceteris paribus, the lenders' risk profile. Users are granted access to the platform after they have successfully passed Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) screening and purchased Salt Membership Units (SALT), an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.<ref name="whitepaper"/>
