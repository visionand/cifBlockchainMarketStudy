==Short Description==

Worldwide Asset eXchange (WAX) is a project initiated by OPSkins, a centralized online marketplace and trading platform for video gamers and digital item traders.<ref name="opskins"/> The project's purpose is to decentralize said platform and to enable users to buy and sell digital assets in a peer-to-peer manner leveraging blockchain technology.<ref name="website">https://wax.io/, accessed on 18.09.2018.</ref> Thus, several problems currently hindering market growth such as high fees due to cross-border transactions or the risk of items being stolen by untrustworthy agents can be overcome. WAX builds its own blockchain, which is secured by a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus algorithm. There are four key actors in the WAX ecosystem â€“ Users, Guilds, Transfer Agents and Contracts. Users are able to create and sign transactions with their key pair. Guilds are nodes elected by users to create blocks and thereby process transactions. Furthermore, there are Transfer Agents who conduct the in-game transfer of items by acquiring the asset from the seller, verifying its authenticity, handing it over to the buyer and confirming the transaction on the blockchain. Finally, contract addresses consist of code and can be executed by sending a transaction to them. In the future, it might be possible to transfer the digital goods directly (P2P) without the need for Transfer Agents if game publishers allow WAX to tokenize these virtual assets. To incentivize sellers to deliver the item as agreed beforehand, a reputation score is implemented helping to create trust between the interacting parties.<ref name="whitepaper"/>
