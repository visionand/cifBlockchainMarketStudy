==Short Description==

Proxeus is a Swiss- and Liechtenstein-based company that is aimed at upgrading conventional business systems by offering a simple framework to create decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Thus, enterprises will be able to relocate their legal, financing, sales, production, human resources and payment processes to the blockchain. As the aforementioned vision is a long-term project, the company currently focuses on developing blockchain-based solutions for three main realms: Logistics & trade finance, proof of existence and legal & compliance. The first field includes trade finance, algorithmic insurance and more. Proof of existence involves certification on a blockchain of anything that is unique and not transferable (e.g. course certificates at the University of Basel). The last realm is about digitization of legal and compliance processes such as Token Generating Events (TGEs). The technology offered by Proxeus consists of the base layer (Proxeus core), the middle layer (Proxeus modules) and the top layer (DApps). The base layer is designed to generate human- and machine-readable documents. The middle layer extends the base layer by adding several functionalities such as monitoring blockchain activities, payment and more. Finally, the top layer brings these two layers together and a front-end allows users to create DApps in a simplified way. Proxeus won the Swiss FinTech Award in the category "Early Stage Start-up of the Year" in 2018.<ref>https://www.fuw.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/press-release-swiss-fintech-awards-2018-1.pdf, accessed on 05.07.2018.</ref><ref name=„tech“/><ref name=„whitepaper“/>
