==Short Description==

Oraclize is a trustless yet centralized oracle service aiming to provide smart contracts and blockchain applications on several platforms with real life data. By October 2018, the service is connected to the blockchains Ethereum, Rootstock, R3 Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and EOS. Oraclize sees considerable inefficiencies when it comes to decentralized oracles because data inputs must be provided by a great number of untrusted parties. In addition, standards for data format must be defined. For this reason, the start-up developed a solution where users do not have to trust the centralized oracle due to the presence of so-called authenticity proofs submitted by Oraclize along with data. These proofs guarantee the integrity of the data provided. Several data source types are supported such as URLs, WolframAlpha, IPFS, random bytes (running on Ledger Nano S.) or arbitrary computation. For different types of data sources, other kinds of authenticity proofs are suitable. That is, so-called TLSNotary and Android Proofs are applicable to data sources such as URLs and computation while Ledger Proofs which are based on hardware cryptocurrency wallets are only suited for random bytes data sources. Since proofs can be very large files and therefore potentially cause high EVM execution costs when submitted directly, they are stored on IPFS and only a pointer to file is delivered instead.<ref name="documentation"/>
