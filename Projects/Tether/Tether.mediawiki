==Short Description==

Tether claims to be a stable token based on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum main net and, in the future, also on the Litecoin blockchain that is pegged to fiat currencies.<ref name=„whitepaper“/><ref name="update"/> However, according to their rich list, the Tether implementation on the Bitcoin blockchain is the largest.<ref name="rich list">https://wallet.tether.to/richlist, accessed on 04.08.2018.</ref> To avoid price volatility, Tether Limited (holding company) states to hold reserves greater than or equal to the total amount of Tether tokens in circulation. Tether Limited states that Tethers can be converted at a one-to-one exchange rate into fiat currency at any time. The Tether system consists of three layers: the Bitcoin blockchain, the  Omni Layer protocol and Tether Limited. Hereby, the Bitcoin blockchain is used as a basic transactional ledger. Because tokens cannot directly be created on the Bitcoin blockchain, Tether Limited makes use of the Omni Layer protocol (second layer) that is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and enables the issuance of tokens. The last layer consists of the company itself that is responsible for the control of both Tethers and reserves. Tether Limited identifies the centralized management of fiat currency reserves as a weakness in the Tether system. Therefore, bank account balances are being published on the [https://wallet.tether.to/transparency website’s transparency page] and bank deposits are regularly being monitored by an independent and professional auditor.<ref name=„whitepaper“>
