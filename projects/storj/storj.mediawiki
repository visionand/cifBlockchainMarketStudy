==Short Description==

Storj is a platform for decentralized cloud storage services created by the company Storj Labs Inc. The platform is using the Ethereum blockchain (mainnet). Similar to other projects in this area, files are being shredded into data chunks (so-called shards) and encrypted before being sent to storage providers. Storj uses a distributed hash table (Kademlia) to allocate the shards among a variety of hosts. Redundancy of data is introduced through Erasure Coding algorithms that guarantee the availability of files even when a certain amount of hosts go offline. Because the data owner is the only one who holds the private keys, data chunks cannot be read nor can they be located correctly by malicious attackers. Initially, Storj launched a Counterparty token (SJCX) that runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Due to network congestion, high transaction fees and long transaction times they decided to convert the Counterparty token on a 1:1 basis into an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2017, they sold the ERC-20 token STORJ in an initial coin offering (ICO) to investors and raised about $30 million worth of funds. This token can now be used to pay for the storage services. Renting one gigabyte of hard drive space on the Storj network costs 0.015$ per month while the price for downloading is 0.05$ per gigabyte.<ref name=”whitepaper”> https://storj.io/storj.pdf, accessed on 18.04.2018.</ref><ref name=”beginner”> https://coincentral.com/storj-beginners-guide/, accessed on 18.04.2018</ref><ref>https://icodrops.com/storj/, accessed on 16.04.2018.</ref><ref name=”website”/><ref>https://docs.storj.io/docs/migrate-tokens-from-sjcx-to-storj, accessed on 09.06.2018</ref>
