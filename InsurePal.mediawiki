==Short Description==
InsurePal is a self-regulating, decentralized insurance platform that applies social proof to different segments of insurance. Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that reinforces self regulation. Currently the insurance industry`s problem is the lack of proper segmentation that results in higher premiums for insurees in different segments. This can be illustrated by an example for car insurances. The premium income of the safe drivers is partly used to finance the damage caused by bad drivers. A driver who hasn't had an accident for years, we call him John, actually pays a $1000 premium. InsurePal aims to connect safe drivers like John to achieve a premium decline and reduce the existing misallocation of premiums. More precisely John has the opportunity to choose a friend as endorser, in our case Mary, that guarantees for him with her credit card data and exposes herself to a potential payment. In return she receives an immediate reward of $100 USD worth in IPL tokens. John can reduce his initial premium up to 50% due to this endorsement. Let`s assume in our example that John saves 40% of his premium. Mary's credit card will only be charged by $550, consisting of $400 of Johns savings, $100 of her cash-back bonus and $50 of penalties, when John is at-fault for an accident within the next year. If there is no such claim John only paid $600 for his car insurance while Mary received $100 of IPL tokens. John can further reduce his premium by finding other endorsers. Based on the social proof, the endorsement of peers motivates John to drive safer. <ref name="Whitepaper"/>

==Funding==
The ICO of InsurePal took place on January 16th in 2018. The price for one IPL token was $0.1. Total token amount is 300m where 67% were available for token crowdsale. The last third was mostly shared by the InsurePal team and their advisors. The soft cap was 5m and the hard cap 18m. They achieved 12m in the pre-sale round. The last 6m were raised in only 80 seconds. Due to this short period every participant has profited of the bonus scheme and therefore received another discount of 10%. <ref>https://icodrops.com/insurepal/, access 06/26/18.</ref>


==Revenue Model==
Software as a Service (SaaS) and License Fee

==Additional Informations==
The website does not have the latest team numbers, see [https://medium.com/insurepal-blog/meet-the-insurepal-team-1927257e783d Medium]. In the Whitepaper there is no concrete figure about the support team available (page 47) so the total team number is only a approximation out of all these informations.
